PVP 
[1] - create empty 3 x 3 grid

[2] - prompt from terminal to ask for player 1 / 2 inputs. 

[3] - input into grid
input x ==> into grid

how to define location?
so what would input look like? 
- start with co-ordinates. e.g (0,1) = first row, second column. (to middle)
- 'bottom left, bottom right' - stretch goal

return new grid with previous input.

ask next player for their move. 

create a win/ loose algorithm 
-3 in a row wins. 
- how does computer see 3 in a row? 
- if all 9 squares are full, no player has 3 in a row, game is over. 

future target: PVComputer
